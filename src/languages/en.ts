          Located at Praia da Barrinha, near Garopaba, this summer residence received 
          a landscaping project that acts in an integrated way with the architecture 
          and the natural surroundings. The composition values native species adapted 
          to the coastal climate, organized in dense masses, with variations in texture, 
          height and tonality along the paths. On the facade, landscaping plays a 
          functional and aesthetic role: it softens the built volumes, creates transitions 
          with the terrain and contributes to the privacy of internal environments. In 
          the pool area, vegetation surrounds the space with subtlety, offering visual 
          protection, shade and a sense of shelter — without losing the permeability of 
          the landscape. The adopted language prioritizes organic lines, low maintenance 
          and a fluid relationship between interior and exterior, reinforcing the welcoming 
          and contemporary character of the house. More than a decorative garden, it is 
          a living system that accompanies the time of the house and expands its experience 
          of use throughout the seasons.

          At Praia da Silveira, in Garopaba, the project starts from the landscape to 
          sculpt its own form. The organic pool, main gesture of the design, is born 
          from the topography and curves in harmony with the contours of the hill and 
          the cove ahead. The implantation respects the natural relief and proposes a 
          subtle connection between architecture and nature. The garden, minimal in its 
          intervention, acts as a transition between the built terrain and the existing 
          native forest — stitching the new to the place. The vegetation was maintained 
          as protagonist, reinforcing the sensation of immersion and belonging. The project 
          values formal and material restraint, letting the surroundings take the 
          protagonism of the experience.

          In Xangri-lá, the revitalization of this garden started from dialogue with 
          the pre-existence to propose new layers of life and use. The vegetation was 
          reorganized with subtlety, respecting the consolidated species and reinforcing 
          the tropical and beachy character of the terrain. The new pool, now protagonist 
          of the external space, assumes a generous layout and invites to conviviality. 
          Two waterfalls in natural rock bring sonority and movement to the garden, 
          reinforcing the presence of water as a central element. The vegetal composition 
          is structured in different planes, with large species, dense foliage and 
          texture variations that create depth and visual fluidity. The result is an 
          exuberant and functional garden that values the house, welcomes the family 
          and enhances outdoor living.

          The extensive terrain houses tennis courts, football, multisport and even a 
          paintball area, composing a bold program, but balanced by the constant presence 
          of green. The choice of native species adapted to the coastal climate ensured 
          rusticity, autonomy and visual unity to the ensemble. Masses of grasses and 
          fine-textured vegetation guide the eye and define the paths with lightness,

          punctual use of stone walls and natural coatings reinforces the local materiality, 
          bringing solidity and elegance to the composition. It is a garden of large

          In the heart of the Três Figueiras neighborhood, in Porto Alegre, the first 
          stage of the Farroupilha School landscaping reveals a new urban gesture. More 
          than an aesthetic intervention, the project proposes a sensitive reconfiguration 
          of the relationship between school, city and community. What was once just a 
          facade becomes a space for coexistence and permanence. The sidewalks expand 
          their function and transform into living environments, where benches, vegetation, 
          shadows and furniture compose a welcoming ambiance — an invitation to pause, 
          encounter and observation. The organic lines of the layout and the careful 
          choice of species reveal an authorial landscaping that softens the rhythm of 
          the city and welcomes those who pass by. In a capital marked by contrasts and 
          scarcity of quality public areas, opening to the surroundings is an act of 
          generosity. Each decision — from the fluid design to the integrated furniture — 
          reflects a commitment to urban kindness, transforming everyday life with 
          subtlety and intention. It is a place designed for everyone, where the project 
          finds its meaning in shared experience.

          composition. Positioned over a bed of vegetation, it creates the sensation of 
          a floating piece, bringing elegance and identity to the environment. The 
          landscaping was designed to surround the fire pit and follow the perimeter of 
          the terrace, using low-maintenance tropical species that guarantee texture, 
          volume and aesthetic permanence throughout the year. The furniture, with pure 
          lines and resistant materials, maintains visual unity and dialogues with the 
          exposed concrete and neutral floor. The result is a cohesive, comfortable and

          a staircase that extends into step-benches, rest landings and viewpoints, 
          connecting levels and inviting permanence. Glass railings and metallic elements 
          maintain the transparency of the edges and reinforce the continuous reading 
          of the path, valuing the view and the sunset. The landscaping organizes the 
          roof in strips: structural masses of sculptural foliage next to the circulations 
          and, in the background, grasses and ornamental grasses of varied texture and 
          size. The species were selected for their adaptation to the southern climate 
          and low maintenance — high resistance to wind, sunlight and intensive use. 
          The ensemble balances technical robustness and material elegance, resulting 
          in a cohesive, generous and durable public terrace.

          Tropical species were arranged in layers, with dense borders and plant masses that ensure privacy while maintaining visual fluidity. The garden gently follows the architectural design, connecting to the pool and terrace in a continuous dialogue between shade, light and materiality.

          The street was designed at a single level, eliminating level differences between the sidewalk and the roadway and creating a continuous, accessible and inviting space. The natural basalt coating provides visual unity and resistance, dialoguing with local materiality and reinforcing the durable character of the ensemble.

          The trees organize the landscape and draw zones of fresh shade, softening the scale of the street and creating rhythm and thermal comfort along the path. The project incorporates urban furniture in contemporary lines, which offer points of permanence and support for pedestrians, in addition to discrete markers that delimit circulation areas with safety and subtlety.

          More than an access, the space was thought of as an environment of coexistence and qualified passage, where infrastructure, nature and urban design come together to promote a more human, inviting and sustainable daily life.

The vegetation acts as a mediating element between architecture and territory, organizing paths and permanence areas without interrupting the visual relationship with the sea, respecting the topography and natural voids of the terrain. The result is a landscaping that builds atmosphere and experience, where nature, climate and architecture integrate in a discreet, sensory and deeply connected way to the place.

          Located in José Ignacio, the garden is structured from a sensitive reading of the place, valuing the naturalistic character, the discreet charm and the rusticity proper to the local landscape. The project seeks an unpretentious relationship with nature, where vegetation organizes itself in an apparently spontaneous way, with a predominance of species adapted to the coastal climate, wind and salinity. Grasses, shrub masses and permeable areas create layers of texture and movement, allowing the garden to change over time and seasons, reinforcing a simple, natural and deeply connected experience to the spirit of José Ignacio.

          Located in Garopaba, the garden is built as a welcoming and permanence space, where landscaping acts as a natural extension of architecture and surroundings. The project explores the diversity of textures and volumes, combining tropical species and vegetation adapted to the local climate to create a dense, fresh and inviting atmosphere. The striking presence of an intensely flowering vine introduces color, shade and movement, reinforcing the affective character of the space and qualifying the living areas. In the pool area, the garden opens up and dissolves into the surrounding landscape, establishing a smooth transition between the built space and nature, in a set that privileges comfort, sensoriality and a direct relationship with the natural environment of Garopaba.

The vegetation, worked in subtle masses and natural textures, acts as a frame for the scenario, without competing with it, reinforcing the atmosphere of calm and contemplation. The landscaping breathes the essence of Barrinha, translating into a built space a place where time slows down and the landscape guides the experience.

On a large scale, landscaping assumes a structuring role, organizing areas of coexistence, leisure and circulation, and contributing to the identity of the neighborhood as a whole. The design of squares, tree planting, green areas and the careful choice of street and sidewalk paving materials were conceived in an articulated way, seeking durability, environmental comfort and aesthetic coherence. More than residual spaces, the external environments of Prado Bairro Cidade build a living, accessible and welcoming urban landscape, where public space is valued as a place of encounter, permanence and belonging.

        `A strategic first step for those who need clarity before deciding.

Consulting helps understand the potential of the land, align expectations and avoid expensive or misaligned decisions early on. It's ideal for those still structuring the project, evaluating possibilities or needing technical guidance before moving forward.`,
        `The Landscape Feasibility Study is a strategic product for those who need to understand the potential of outdoor areas based on available budget.

It transforms intentions into numbers, scenarios and real possibilities, before full project development. At Krebs+, this study crosses market knowledge, implementation costs, use typologies and initial conceptual development, creating a clear panorama of what is possible to do in outdoor areas, and at what level, within the client's budget.

The focus is on guiding decisions:
how much to invest, where to concentrate resources, which solutions generate more impact and which paths make sense technically, aesthetically and financially.

The result is a strategic direction for the entrepreneur, reducing risks and avoiding projects misaligned with reality.

Unlike consulting, here we deliver data, estimates and concrete directions, which serve as a basis for the Master Plan, for the project and for executive decisions.
`,
        `The Master Plan defines the general concept of the project and guides the development as a whole.

More than a landscaping stage, it functions as a strategic direction, capable of revealing the potential of the place and guiding decisions from the start through a well-developed implementation.

At this moment, we organize flows, uses, atmospheres and language, building a clear and integrated vision of the whole before technical detailing. The Master Plan connects landscape, architecture and urbanism, aligning experience, identity and viability.

It is the basis for safe decisions, for consistent project evolution and for avoiding disconnected paths throughout development. An instrument of reading, synthesis and direction that transforms intention into structure.
`,
        `The project is the heart of our work.

It is where financial viability, market knowledge, client desires, well-being and place identity meet and take shape.

At Krebs+, project development goes far beyond design. It is born from studies, investigations and research conducted by partners, who analyze the terrain, context, use, budget and client expectations to build coherent, executable and timeless solutions.

The process goes through clear stages: project investigation, preliminary study, preliminary design and executive project. Where each decision is matured technically, aesthetically and financially. The result is a complete landscape architecture and exterior project, with precise definitions of species, materials, constructive solutions and implementation guidelines.

Designed to flow naturally into construction, the project reduces improvisation, avoids incompatibilities and ensures the concept is preserved until execution.
`,
        `Images developed as commercial tools to communicate projects with clarity and impact.

They help the end client understand the value of the proposal and strengthen real estate launches, institutional presentations and marketing materials.

They are strategic resources for sales, project approval and development positioning, translating concepts into images that facilitate decision-making.`,
        `Construction supervision begins together with the project, not just in execution.

From the initial stages, landscaping is already developed considering financial viability, logistics and implementation form. This allows that, when construction begins, decisions are mature and aligned with field reality.

During execution, we act with continuous technical support, ensuring the project is faithfully implemented. We monitor construction decisions, guide teams we ourselves help select and adjust details when necessary, always preserving the concept, budget and final quality.

This process avoids improvisation, cost deviations and last-minute solutions that compromise the result. Supervision efficiently connects project and execution, transforming design into reality with control and precision.`,
        `Complete Garden Execution is the stage where the project becomes reality, with method, control and technical responsibility.

The execution is not an isolated service: it is born integrated with the project, financial viability and strategic decisions made from the start.

We assume total responsibility for garden implementation, managing planning, logistics, plant supply, labor, schedule and quality control. Each stage is conducted based on decisions already matured in the project, avoiding improvisation, cost deviations and quality losses in the field.

We work with oriented teams and suppliers selected according to the project profile, ensuring that what was thought conceptually, technically and financially is faithfully executed. The result is a ready-delivered garden, coherent with the project, with the defined budget and with high finishing standards.`,
        `Plant sales at Krebs+ goes beyond traditional supply.

We use an internal intelligence platform, developed from our market experience, that crosses technical, regional and financial information to indicate the most suitable species for each project.

This platform gathers data such as regional availability, acquisition costs, logistics, species size, climate adaptation and impact on the implemented garden value. With this, we can choose plants that make aesthetic, technical and economic sense for each situation.

The result is more efficient, viable landscaping coherent with the project, without cost surprises or inadequate choices.`,
