          Located at Praia da Barrinha, near Garopaba, this summer residence received 
          a landscaping project that acts in an integrated way with the architecture 
          and the natural surroundings. The composition values native species adapted 
          to the coastal climate, organized in dense masses, with variations in texture, 
          height and tonality along the paths. On the facade, landscaping plays a 
          functional and aesthetic role: it softens the built volumes, creates transitions 
          with the terrain and contributes to the privacy of internal environments. In 
          the pool area, vegetation surrounds the space with subtlety, offering visual 
          protection, shade and a sense of shelter — without losing the permeability of 
          the landscape. The adopted language prioritizes organic lines, low maintenance 
          and a fluid relationship between interior and exterior, reinforcing the welcoming 
          and contemporary character of the house. More than a decorative garden, it is 
          a living system that accompanies the time of the house and expands its experience 
          of use throughout the seasons.

          At Praia da Silveira, in Garopaba, the project starts from the landscape to 
          sculpt its own form. The organic pool, main gesture of the design, is born 
          from the topography and curves in harmony with the contours of the hill and 
          the cove ahead. The implantation respects the natural relief and proposes a 
          subtle connection between architecture and nature. The garden, minimal in its 
          intervention, acts as a transition between the built terrain and the existing 
          native forest — stitching the new to the place. The vegetation was maintained 
          as protagonist, reinforcing the sensation of immersion and belonging. The project 
          values formal and material restraint, letting the surroundings take the 
          protagonism of the experience.

          In Xangri-lá, the revitalization of this garden started from dialogue with 
          the pre-existence to propose new layers of life and use. The vegetation was 
          reorganized with subtlety, respecting the consolidated species and reinforcing 
          the tropical and beachy character of the terrain. The new pool, now protagonist 
          of the external space, assumes a generous layout and invites to conviviality. 
          Two waterfalls in natural rock bring sonority and movement to the garden, 
          reinforcing the presence of water as a central element. The vegetal composition 
          is structured in different planes, with large species, dense foliage and 
          texture variations that create depth and visual fluidity. The result is an 
          exuberant and functional garden that values the house, welcomes the family 
          and enhances outdoor living.

          In Punta del Este, the landscaping of this residence expands the horizons of 
          living by integrating sport, nature and contemplation in the same language. 
          The extensive terrain houses tennis courts, football, multisport and even a 
          paintball area, composing a bold program, but balanced by the constant presence 
          of green. The choice of native species adapted to the coastal climate ensured 
          rusticity, autonomy and visual unity to the ensemble. Masses of grasses and 
          fine-textured vegetation guide the eye and define the paths with lightness, 
          while the open planes dialogue with the vastness of the surroundings. The 
          punctual use of stone walls and natural coatings reinforces the local materiality, 
          bringing solidity and elegance to the composition. It is a garden of large 
          proportions and clear intentions, where landscaping acts as mediator between 
          active living and the silence of the Uruguayan landscape.

          In the heart of the Três Figueiras neighborhood, in Porto Alegre, the first 
          stage of the Farroupilha School landscaping reveals a new urban gesture. More 
          than an aesthetic intervention, the project proposes a sensitive reconfiguration 
          of the relationship between school, city and community. What was once just a 
          facade becomes a space for coexistence and permanence. The sidewalks expand 
          their function and transform into living environments, where benches, vegetation, 
          shadows and furniture compose a welcoming ambiance — an invitation to pause, 
          encounter and observation. The organic lines of the layout and the careful 
          choice of species reveal an authorial landscaping that softens the rhythm of 
          the city and welcomes those who pass by. In a capital marked by contrasts and 
          scarcity of quality public areas, opening to the surroundings is an act of 
          generosity. Each decision — from the fluid design to the integrated furniture — 
          reflects a commitment to urban kindness, transforming everyday life with 
          subtlety and intention. It is a place designed for everyone, where the project 
          finds its meaning in shared experience.

          with curvilinear lines and glass protection, is the central element of the 
          composition. Positioned over a bed of vegetation, it creates the sensation of 
          a floating piece, bringing elegance and identity to the environment. The 
          landscaping was designed to surround the fire pit and follow the perimeter of 
          the terrace, using low-maintenance tropical species that guarantee texture, 
          volume and aesthetic permanence throughout the year. The furniture, with pure 
          lines and resistant materials, maintains visual unity and dialogues with the 
          exposed concrete and neutral floor. The result is a cohesive, comfortable and 
          visually balanced space, designed for contemplation and conviviality.

          In Pelotas, the Ramp project transforms the building's roof into an active

          a staircase that extends into step-benches, rest landings and viewpoints, 
          connecting levels and inviting permanence. Glass railings and metallic elements 
          maintain the transparency of the edges and reinforce the continuous reading 
          of the path, valuing the view and the sunset. The landscaping organizes the 
          roof in strips: structural masses of sculptural foliage next to the circulations 
          and, in the background, grasses and ornamental grasses of varied texture and 
          size. The species were selected for their adaptation to the southern climate 
          and low maintenance — high resistance to wind, sunlight and intensive use. 
          The ensemble balances technical robustness and material elegance, resulting 
          in a cohesive, generous and durable public terrace.

The natural basalt coating provides visual unity and resistance, dialoguing with local materiality and reinforcing the durable character of the ensemble.

Garopaba is also on this path: a summer vacation place, gatherings, waves and lived time, which shaped who we are.

          When Surfland emerged, everything simply fell into place. The project brings together wellness at scale, active leisure, nature, community and purpose, exactly the kind of impact we believe landscape architecture can generate. More than a surf park, Surfland represents a lifestyle. Being part of this story is something we carry in a very special way.

        description: `
          Located in front of the sea, in La Barra, the PAIX building establishes a direct dialogue with the coastal landscape and its natural forces, especially the constant wind and the maritime condition of the place. The landscaping project starts from valuing these characteristics, adopting mostly native species, resistant to salinity and weather, which not only support the environment, but reveal their power through movement, textures and variations over time. The vegetation acts as a mediating element between architecture and territory, organizing paths and permanence areas without interrupting the visual relationship with the sea, respecting the topography and natural voids of the terrain. The result is a landscaping that builds atmosphere and experience, where nature, climate and architecture integrate in a discreet, sensory and deeply connected way to the place.

          Located in a consolidated area of Porto Alegre, the Iguaçu Building proposes a careful relationship between architecture, city and open spaces. The external spaces project starts from the creation of qualified permanence areas, capable of offering urban breathing, environmental comfort and a more sensitive daily experience for users. The landscaping organizes the paths, defines transitions between public and private space and introduces layers of vegetation that balance scale, shade and visual permeability. The choice of species prioritizes resistance, low maintenance and suitability to the local climate, composing a sober and timeless landscape that accompanies the architecture without excessive protagonism. More than support areas, the external spaces of the Iguaçu Building act as an extension of internal life, promoting well-being, pause and connection with nature in the midst of the urban fabric.
